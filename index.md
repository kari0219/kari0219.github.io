# Field Experiments: Design and Analysis 

###  Gender Bias in Programming Reviews
Survey design, administration, and analysis to test the hypothesis that gender bias exists in SW code reviews.
Analysis was performed using Intent-to-Treat estimator in order to produce an unbiased estimator.
The results did not support the hypothesis that code authored by a female would be rated less favorably.

# Statistical Analysis

### Regression and EDA on 1989 Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. 
EDA and model exploration (simplified logistical regression, probit, and complementary log-log regression).  Four of the 5 models were logistical regression with different predictors.  Analysis of Variance was used to compare the models, with the final model selection being a simplified logistical model based on temperature data.
